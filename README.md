# rnn-metric-learning
Solving product matching problem with RNN metric learning (seq2seq encoder) and gradient boosting on string distances.

3 pipelines:

- K-NN on tf-idf representations
- Metric learning on text embeddings created by character seq2seq encoder
- Gradient boosting on engineered string distances
